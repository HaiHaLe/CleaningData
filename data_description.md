# Data description

tidydata.txt file is the tidy data summarised from the data in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
It consists of the average values of 579 variables grouped by activities and subjects. With 6 activities and 30 subjects, there are <br/>
180 records in the tidydata.txt
<br/>
<br/>
Variables in the tidydata.txt are (in the order) <br/>
1. Activity_Id: activity id which is described in the activity_labels.txt file <br/>
2. Activity_label: the names of activities, i.e., walking, walking upstair, walking downstair, sitting, standing and laying <br/>
3. Subject_Id: the identifier number of 30 volunteers <br/>
4. TotalAcc_mean_X: the mean of total acceleration in the X direction <br/>
5. TotalAcc_std_X: the standard deviation of total acceleration in the X direction <br/>
6. TotalAcc_mean_Y: the mean of total acceleration in the Y direction <br/>
7. TotalAcc_std_Y: the standard deviation of total acceleration in the Y direction <br/>
8. TotalAcc_mean_Z: the mean of total acceleration in the Z direction <br/>
9. TotalAcc_std_Z: the standard deviation of total acceleration in the Z direction <br/>
10. BodyAcc_mean_X: the mean of body acceleration in the X direction <br/>
11. BodyAcc_std_X: the standard deviation of body acceleration in the X direction <br/>
12. BodyAcc_mean_Y: the mean of body acceleration in the Y direction <br/>
13. BodyAcc_std_Y: the standard deviation of body acceleration in the Y direction <br/>
14. BodyAcc_mean_Z: the mean of body acceleration in the Z direction <br/>
15. BodyAcc_std_Z: the standard deviation of body acceleration in the Z direction <br/>
16. BodyGyro_mean_X: the mean of body angular velocity in the X direction <br/>
17. BodyAcc_std_X: the standard deviation of body angular velocity in the X direction <br/>
18. BodyAcc_mean_Y: the mean of body angular velocity in the Y direction <br/>
19. BodyAcc_std_Y: the standard deviation of body angular velocity in the Y direction <br/>
20. BodyAcc_mean_Z: the mean of body angular velocity in the Z direction <br/>
21. BodyAcc_std_Z: the standard deviation of body angular velocity in the Z direction <br/>
